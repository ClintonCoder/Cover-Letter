Re:  Application Developer Placement

Dear Hiring Manager David,

From revolutionising the world of tutoring to being recognised as one of the top 100 startups in the UK with over 2 million lessons taught, Tutorful has captivated my attention with its unwavering commitment to accessibility and innovation. 

As a second-year Computer Science student with Cyber Security at the University of Huddersfield, I am thrilled at the prospect of joining your dynamic team as a student software engineer.  My deep interest in software engineering traces back to my childhood, where I avidly explored programming using a Raspberry Pi motherboard whilst attaining a short scholarship to China as a foreign exchange student, which captivated and enhanced my deep curiosity for software. 

What truly resonates with me about Tutorful are the core values that underpin your organisation's ethos. With a profound commitment to putting the customer first, striving for impactful outcomes, promoting openness and transparency, excelling within autonomous teams, being a supportive colleague, and making data-informed decisions, your values seamlessly align with my own principles. 

As an aspiring Android developer, I served as a backend developer for CodeConnect which is a personal project I initiated. Although I initially started with Kotlin due to its easy access to APIs, I created with a functional website from scratch with my peers, integrating JavaScript libraries and leveraging the power of the Levenshtein word similarity algorithm. Despite encountering challenges, my adept problem-solving skills facilitated the resolution of issues; attesting that rigorous testing is needed and I thrive in collaborative environments. The previous placement studentâ€™s statement intrigued me, and I have become more interested in joining to enhance my skills.

Moreover, my attention to detail, strong verbal and written communication skills will enable me to effectively convey complex technical concepts to both internal team members and external stakeholders. I am driven by the opportunity to immerse myself in the thriving environment at Tutorful, where innovation and growth are at the forefront; whilst gaining real life exposure.

I believe that I am an excellent candidate, and it would be an honour to join your well esteemed team whilst making an impact from day one. I eagerly look forward to discussing how I can add value to Tutorful and contribute to its continued success.                                                                                    


Yours faithfully,	 Clinton
